## Use `nitro.azure.config` property instead of `staticwebapp.config.json` file

When you set [`preset: azure`](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/azure), Nitro automatically generates a `staticwebapp.config.json` file so that it can work properly with Azure Static Web Apps.  
This behavior overwrites the existing file in the root, so your previous settings will not work.  
The value of [`nitro.azure.config`](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/azure#custom-configuration) will be reflected in the generated file, so your app settings should be written here.

To ensure that you write your configuration correctly, Nuxt SWA provides a type definition for `nitro.azure.config`.  
And, some of the Nuxt SWA settings are automatically retrieved from `nitro.azure.config`.
